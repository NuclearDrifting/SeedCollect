The name of the game 'Seed Collector'. You are a cardinal who is about to die unless he eats enough seeds.

You use W,A, and D to move around. W is used to jump while A and D are used to move left and right. 

This game was created in Unity 2D as a single player experience that is meant to be played on a keyboard. 
In total it should not take more than 14 seconds, with a 10 second timer for the actual game.
In the beginning players will have time to read text that explains what to do. 
To win the game collect 5 seeds before the 10 seconds are up. 
If you collect the 5 seeds within 10 seconds you will receive a message that will give you options to restart or quit.

When the player starts the game there will be some background ambiance from a park. 
If the player wins there will be a sound that plays, if they lose it will be a
lower pitched sound. 
Currently this does not work as intended and I do know that it will hurt my points. 
During gameplay however a sound effect will play when
you collect a seed.

The game takes place in a forested area with mountains in the background. 
The main character is a sprite of a cardinal that changes depending on if the player is on the ground or mid jump. 
The environment has a fog that is similar to what would be going on near the morning or dusk. 
As well as UI elements that show the time left and the amount of seeds collected total.
